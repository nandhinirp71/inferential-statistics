## Hypothesis Testing

In Hypothesis Testing, 2 or more mutually exclusive statements are evaluated on a population using sample data.

Example :
1. The defendent is guilty
2. The defendent is not guilty

Steps:
1. Make Initial Assumption (null hypothesis or H0)
2. Collect Data
3. Gather evidence to reject or not reject null hypothesis
